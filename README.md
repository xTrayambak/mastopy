# Mastopy -- a frontend to Twitter

This is a work in progress Python program written in Kivy to provide a (hopefully) good desktop interface to Mastodon
that does not require opening your browser. It is 100% FOSS and is licensed under the GPLv2. We aim to make this as
lightweight as possible.

# Features
- Lightweight, uses very little system resources, thanks to the Kivy framework
- Still somewhat visually pleasing via KivyMD, appearance is subject to change and we have plans to add proper custom
  styling in the future
- Uses Mastodon's official API, no OAuth logins required
- Licensed under a very permissive copyleft license
- Cross-platform

# Future Features
- Tight integration with notification daemons for all platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac, iOS, Android)
- Flatpak, Snap, AUR, COPR and PPA builds
- LUA scripting for extending functionality further
